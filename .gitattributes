# When text is set to "auto", the path is marked for automatic end-of-line normalization. 
# If Git decides that the content is text, its line endings are normalized to LF on checkin.
#  The core.eol configuration variable controls which line endings Git will use for 
# normalized files in your working directory; the default is to use the native line ending for
# your platform, or CRLF if core.autocrlf is set.
* text=auto

# Explicitly declare text files you want to always be normalized and converted
# to native line endings on checkout (if core.eol is not set).
